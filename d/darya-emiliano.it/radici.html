	<h3>Reservations</h3>
	<p>Please let us know your travel plans and we can make a reservation for you. Since the hotel has only a few rooms, we recommend making reservations well in advance.</p>

	<h3>Restaurant and Spa</h3>
	<p>The hotel has an excellent restaurant (<a href="http://www.morabianca.com/" target=_blank>Ristorante Morabianca</a>), which is open everyday for lunch, and Monday&ndash;Saturday for dinner (until 11.30pm) The restaurant is owned by Mastroberardino, one of the most renowned wine producers in the south of Italy (in fact, the name of the resort, Radici, is the name of their best-known wine). You can order &agrave; la carte, but we recommend the tasting menu with paired wines (€ 55/person).<br>
	The hotel also has a spa, open everyday from 9.30am to 7.30pm, available to guests for a fee of € 25.</p>
