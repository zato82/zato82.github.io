			<h1>Travel Information</h1>
			<p>Villa Assunta is located in Mirabella Eclano, 40km (45min drive) northeast of Emiliano's hometown, Avellino.
			</p>
			<p><b>Mirabella Eclano</b> has only a couple of (small) hotels, and English is not commonly spoken, so we suggest that guests stay in Avellino.
			</p>
			<p><b>Avellino</b> is the capital of the province (also called Irpinia, from the Latin word for wolf, <i>hirpus</i>), in the southern Italian region of Campania. Although it's relatively small (60,000 people), it's lively in the summer and has a few nice restaurants and cafes. The province of Avellino is known for hazelnuts, tartufi (truffles), torrone (hard candy with hazelnuts and almonds) and a few wines such as Fiano di Avellino, Taurasi, and Greco di Tufo.
			</p>
			<p><b>Campania</b> is the most populated region in the south of Italy. Its capital and best known city is Napoli and it is home to several popular tourist destinations, such as Pompei, Amalfi, Sorrento, Positano, Capri, Ischia, and Caserta. (Scroll down for more information on <a href="#sightseeing">sightseeing</a> in Campania).
			</p>
			<p><b>Getting around:</b> If you are driving to Villa Assunta, please follow the directions on the <a href="reception.html">reception page</a>. 
			<!--Please note that if you search "Villa Assunta" or "Via Capo Di Gaudio" on Google Maps or on a GPS navigation system, you might get the wrong address. We suggest to input the exact GPS coordinates: 41.036816째N, 15.031438째E (or 41째02'12.5", 15째01'53.2").-->
			</p>
            <p><b>Guest Bus Transportation:</b> We will have a private bus service, on the day of the reception, between Avellino and Villa Assunta. The bus will pick up guests from 								Viva Hotel at 11.15am and will return at night, at the end of the reception.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Airports</h1>
			<p><b>Napoli Capodichino (NAP)</b> is the closest airport, with flights to most Italian and European cities. It's 50km west of Avellino (approximately 45min drive). You can get to Avellino either by renting a car or taking a bus &ndash; please click <a href="napoli-bus.html" target=_blank>here</a> for more information on the public transport bus.
			</p>
			<p><b>Roma Fiumicino (FCO)</b> is Italy's largest airport, so you many find it easier to fly here. It's  265km north of Avellino (approximately 2h45min drive). The best way to get to Avellino is to rent a car, but you can also take a <a href="#trains">train</a> to Napoli and, from Napoli, a <a href="#buses">bus</a> to Avellino.
			</p>
			<p><b>Roma Ciampino (CIA)</b> is smaller than Fiumicino and operates low-cost (Ryanair/Easyjet) flights from several European cities. It's 240km north of Avellino (approximately 2h20min drive). Getting to Avellino with public transportation is quite cumbersome so we recommend renting a car if you fly here.
			</p>

Tickets can be bought at any railway station and/or at the airport.
			</p>

			<h1>Car Rental</h1>
			<p>The best way to get around Campania is to rent a car. European and US driving licenses are accepted and insurance is usually covered in the car rental agreement.

            <a class="anchor" id="sightseeing"></a>
			<h1>Sightseeing</h1>
			<p>There are several places in Campania that are definitely worth visiting &mdash; here are some suggestions:</p>
			
			<h2>Amalfi</h2>
			<p>This beautiful little town gives the name to the Amalfi Coast, a breathtaking 50km stretch between Sorrento and Salerno. Lonely Planet writes: "Cliffs terraced with scented lemon groves sheer down into sparkling seas; whitewashed villas cling precariously to unforgiving slopes while sea and sky merge in one vast blue horizon." Besides Amalfi, other towns to visit along the coast include Positano and Ravello. You can drive the windy road and stop at the lookouts for an unforgettable selfie :-), or take a ferry from Salerno (the biggest town close to Amalfi) and enjoy the view from the boat. Let us know if you're planning to stay overnight &ndash; we have some hotel and restaurant recommendations.</p>
            <img class="places" src="img/amalfi.jpg" alt="Amalfi" width="450">

			
			<h2>Pompei</h2>
			<p>Pompei was a flourishing ancient Roman city, which, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was  destroyed and buried under more than 5 meters of ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. After thick layers of ash covered it, Pompei was abandoned and forgotten and rediscovered only in the 16th century, and the first excavations started in 1748. Pompei is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. We also recommend visiting the ruins of <a href="http://www.pompeiisites.org/Sezione.jsp?titolo=Herculaneum&idSezione=556" target=_blank">Hercolanaeum (Ercolano)</a>: while smaller in size, it is usually less crowded and better preserved.</p>
			<img class="places" src="img/pompei.jpg" alt="Pompei" width="450">

			
			<h2>Sorrento</h2>
			<p>Sorrento is at the northernmost tip of the Amalfi coast and is not too far from Pompei. Aside from the beautiful views of the coast, Mount Vesuvio, and Capri island, Sorrento is very picturesque, with a lot of nice cafes, restaurants, and artisan shops. It is also famous for its ceramics as well as the "giant" lemons used to make Limoncello (a famous lemon-based liquor served chilled after lunch or dinner).</p>
			<img class="places" src="img/sorrento.jpg" alt="Sorrento" width="450">
			

			
			<h2>Capri</h2>
			<p>The island of Capri is one of the most popular destinations in the south of Italy, a 40-minute ferry ride from Napoli. It is famous for its fancy cafes and restaurants, nice promenades, and breathtaking cliffs. Don't miss the Grotta Azzurra (Blue Grotto), a sea cave where the sunlight, passing through an underwater cavity, creates an amazing blue reflection.
			</p>
			<img class="places" src="img/capri.jpg" alt="Capri" width="450">
			
			<h2>Napoli</h2>
			<p> Napoli has a lot of history, beautiful architecture, and a unique character. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Napoli was the capital of one of the richest and most advanced kingdoms in Europe, and this is reflected in its architecture. We recommend visiting the castles (Maschio Angioino and Castel Dell'Ovo), Piazza Plebiscito, the "underground" city (Napoli Sotterranea) with chambers and passageways built during Greek times, and the picturesque narrow alleys of the old town buzzing with artisan shops. Undisputedly, Napoli has the greatest pizza in the world :-). Suggested pizzerias include Pizzeria Trianon da Ciro, L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and Pizzeria Di Matteo. You may also want to try the "fritti" (literally, fried stuff) and the pastries (e.g., sfogliatelle, baba, zeppole).
			</p>
			<img class="places" src="img/napoli.jpg" alt="Napoli" width="450">

			<h1>Shopping</h1>
			<p>A few guests have asked us about shopping :-) City centers have a lot of good shops, e.g., Via Roma and Via Toledo in Napoli or Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Corso Europa in Avellino (keep in mind that most of them are closed on Sundays). There is also a good outlet mall, <a href="http://www.mcarthurglen.com/it/la-reggia-designer-outlet/en/" target=_blank>La Reggia Outlet</a>, open 7 days a week, in Marcianise: it's a 20min drive north of Napoli or 45min north west of Avellino (see <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/IdaWY" target=_blank>map</a>) and you would need a car to get there (if you are driving between Roma and Napoli or Avellino, the outlet is going to be on your way).
